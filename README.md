## Overview: 
This project consists of three main Python scripts designed to process flow log data and clean CSV and log files:

**main.py**: Processes flow log data and tags each log entry based on a lookup table. It generates output files containing the counts of each tag and each port/protocol combination.

**clean_csv**.py: Cleans a CSV file by removing leading and trailing whitespace from headers and data fields. It ensures that only non-empty rows are processed and written to the cleaned output file.

**clean_flowlogs.py**: Cleans a flow log file by removing leading and trailing whitespace from each line and discarding empty lines. The cleaned flow log is written to a new output file.

## Prerequisites: 
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:

**Python 3.x**: The scripts are written in Python and require Python 3.x to run.

**Required Libraries**: The scripts use the built-in Python libraries (csv, collections, sys), so no additional installations are required.

**CSV Files**: The main.py and clean_csv.py scripts require input CSV files to operate.

**Flow Log File**: The main.py and clean_flowlogs.py scripts require a flow log file to process.

## Directory Structure:

Your project directory should be structured as follows:

  FlowLogProcessing/


├── main.py

├── clean_csv.py

├── clean_flowlogs.py

├── lookup_table.csv

├── vpc_flowlogs.txt

├── cleaned_vpc_flow_logs.txt

└── lookup_table_clean.csv

**main.py**: Script to process flow logs and generate tag counts and port/protocol combination counts.

**clean_csv.py**: Script to clean a CSV file by removing unnecessary whitespace.

**clean_flowlogs.py**: Script to clean a flow log file by removing unnecessary whitespace.

**lookup_table.csv**: The lookup table used by main.py to tag flow logs.

**vpc_flowlogs.txt**: The raw flow log file to be cleaned and processed.

**cleaned_vpc_flow_logs.txt**: The cleaned version of the vpc_flowlogs.txt file generated by clean_flowlogs.py.

**lookup_table_clean.csv**: The cleaned version of the lookup_table.csv file generated by clean_csv.py.

## Scripts Usage: 

**1. main.py**

Description
The main.py script processes flow log data by matching each log entry with a tag from a lookup table. The script generates two output CSV files:

tag_counts.csv: Contains the counts of each tag.
port_protocol_counts.csv: Contains the counts of each port/protocol combination.

**Command-Line Arguments**:

<flow_log_file>: Path to the input flow log file (e.g., vpc_flowlogs.txt).
<lookup_table_file>: Path to the lookup table CSV file (e.g., lookup_table.csv).

```bash
python3 main.py vpc_flowlogs.txt lookup_table.csv
```

**Output Files**:

tag_counts.csv: A CSV file with the tag and corresponding count.
port_protocol_counts.csv: A CSV file with the port, protocol, and corresponding count.

**Error Handling**:

The script handles missing or incorrectly formatted lines in the flow log file by skipping them and logging a message.
Errors in loading the lookup table or processing the logs (e.g., missing files, incorrect formats) will result in the script printing an error message and exiting.

**2. clean_csv.py**

Description:

The clean_csv.py script cleans a CSV file by removing leading and trailing whitespace from headers and data fields. It writes the cleaned data to a new output file and ensures that only non-empty rows are processed.

**Arguments**:

input_file_path: Path to the input CSV file (e.g., lookup_table.csv).
output_file_path: Path to the output cleaned CSV file (e.g., lookup_table_clean.csv).

```bash
python3 clean_csv.py
```

**Output File**:

lookup_table_clean.csv: A cleaned version of the input CSV file.

**Error Handling**:

The script handles file-related errors such as missing input files and issues during file reading or writing.

**3. clean_flowlogs.py**

Description:

The clean_flowlogs.py script cleans a flow log file by removing leading and trailing whitespace from each line and discarding empty lines. The cleaned flow log is written to a new output file.

**Arguments**:

input_file: Path to the input flow log file (e.g., vpc_flowlogs.txt).
output_file: Path to the output cleaned flow log file (e.g., cleaned_vpc_flow_logs.txt).

**Example Usage**:

```bash
python3 clean_flowlogs.py
```

**Output File**:

cleaned_vpc_flow_logs.txt: A cleaned version of the input flow log file.

**Error Handling**:

The script handles file-related errors such as missing input files and issues during file reading or writing.

**Best Practices Followed**

**1. Error Handling**: All scripts include robust error handling to manage issues such as missing files, incorrect formats, and unexpected exceptions.

**2. Modularity**: Each script focuses on a single responsibility (e.g., processing flow logs, cleaning CSV files), making the code easier to maintain and extend.

**3. Readability**: The code includes comments and docstrings to ensure that it is easy to understand and follow.

**4. File Handling**: The scripts use context managers (with statements) to ensure files are properly opened and closed, preventing resource leaks.
